## Project Description
This project recreates a pre-1990 Urdu newspaper front page using HTML-only layout techniques. The page structure follows a newspaper-like grid with a lead story, a photo area, and boxed briefs, while all Urdu headlines/body text are translated to English and rephrased.

## Features Implemented
- Semantic HTML5 structure: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`
- Newspaper-style grid using a single **table** (3 columns) for layout
- Heading hierarchy using `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`
- Multiple images from the original scan (masthead crop, photo crop, emblem crop)
- Internal anchors for navigation links

## Challenges Faced
Matching the dense, boxed layout without external CSS was the main challenge. I used a table grid for column alignment and kept spacing readable with simple inline HTML attributes.
